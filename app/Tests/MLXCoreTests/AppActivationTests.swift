/// active has NO key window — so a window opened while `.accessory` comes up
/// unemphasized: no blinking caret, no first-responder focus, the title bar
/// looks half-lit. `ActivationPolicyManager` only flips to `.regular` when it
/// sees `didBecomeKeyNotification`… which cannot fire until the app is active.
/// Chicken-and-egg: the window sits semi-focused until the user clicks or types,
/// which finally activates the app, which finally fires the notification, which
/// finally flips the policy. Modal `NSOpenPanel`s (the code-editor folder
/// picker) fail the same way and can't be clicked until you "play around with it".

/// The rule these pin: **flip to `.regular` BEFORE the window/panel is
/// presented, then activate** — never the other way round.
