/// Time-coalesces streamed token deltas so the chat UI is updated at a bounded
/// cadence instead of once per token.
///
/// **Why this exists — the tray-popover freeze.** The chat/agent engine writes
/// streamed tokens into `AppState.chatSessions`, which is `@Published`; every
/// write fires `AppState.objectWillChange`. While the `MenuBarExtra(.window)`
/// tray popover is open during the assistant's answer (the hands-free voice
/// case), that per-token churn re-renders the whole popover dozens-to-hundreds
/// of times a second. In this `LSUIElement` accessory app the popover lives in a
/// non-key panel, so a saturated main run loop starves SwiftUI `Button`
/// hit-testing — the voice **Stop** button goes dead while the AppKit `Menu`
/// (voice picker) and `Picker` (model) keep working from their own NSMenu
/// event-tracking loop. That's the same "tray locks up but the dropdown still
/// opens" wedge the static `VoiceTrayDot` fixed for animations — here the source
/// is data churn, not a `TimelineView`. Throttling the deltas to ~10 Hz leaves
/// the run loop idle between flushes, so events get dispatched and the buttons
/// respond again. Final content is byte-identical; only the *cadence* changes.
///
/// The clock is injected via `now` (seconds, any monotonic source) so the
/// batching is deterministic and unit-testable with no real time — see
/// `StreamCoalescerTests`.
