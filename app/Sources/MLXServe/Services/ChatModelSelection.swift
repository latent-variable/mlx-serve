/// same class as the rule that a chat surface routes through
/// `server.chatModelId` instead of reading the local model name for itself.
///
/// Rows are tagged by string because SwiftUI pickers need a single tag type for
/// two different kinds of row: a local checkpoint (its path) and a model shared
/// by another Mac (its `id@peer`, prefixed so it can never collide with a path).
