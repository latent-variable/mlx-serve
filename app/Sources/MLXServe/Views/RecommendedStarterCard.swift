/// gate. Two copies is how the two recommendations drift apart, and they are

/// the Model Browser's "Best for your Mac" card also reads.

/// selects the model and starts the server (`useModelAndAwaitReady`), because
/// the point of the whole flow is to end in a working chat rather than in a
/// folder of weights the user still has to go and switch on.
