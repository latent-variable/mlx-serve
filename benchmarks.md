# Benchmarks — mlx-serve decode by release

**Update rules — read before editing:**
- Results go into the tables ONLY. No text, no commentary, no per-release notes — `docs/gotchas/` carries the stories.
- **Apple M4 Max 128 GB ONLY.** Do not update these tables from any other machine (e.g. the M4 mini) — numbers across hardware are not comparable and one mixed column poisons the whole history.
- A cell is `./tests/bench.sh` decode tok/s (llmprobe `--bench-only`: warmup discarded, median of 3, its own code-completion prompt), mlx-serve ReleaseFast at its FASTEST config, with the speculative mode that engaged named beside the number. `·` = not measured that release.
- Every column is llmprobe (26.8 on). The pre-26.8 columns from the old in-repo harness were dropped in 26.9.2 — they were never comparable cell to cell. `speedup` = first measured column vs the latest.
