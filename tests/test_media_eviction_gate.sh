# Registry eviction gate vs. a staged-residency media model (#126).
#
# The gate reserves a model's post-load bytes BEFORE the media preflight runs,
# and it used to bill every entry the sum of every safetensors in its dir. For
# MiniMax-H3 that sum (37.55 GiB) is 14.7 GiB more than the model can ever
# hold — the text encoder runs and is FREED before the DiT loads, so the real
# staged peak is 22.83 GiB — and on a 48 GB Mac (auto cap 30.0 GiB) it refused
# every load, permanently, on an idle server with nothing to evict.
#
# Hermetic: the "model" is four SPARSE files with the real pack's byte sizes and
# a config.json naming the backend. Nothing is ever read, so the load fails at
# engine build — which is exactly the point. WHICH failure it is, is the test:
# past the gate the answer is no longer the gate's 503.

# Usage: ./tests/test_media_eviction_gate.sh [port]
