# The release workflow triples as (1) the tag/dispatch RELEASE pipeline,
# (2) the dry-run packaging check, and (3) the PR packaging build that
# signs + notarizes a DMG artifact WITHOUT releasing. The class of bug this
# pins: someone edits a step's `if:` and a PR suddenly creates a tag, a
# GitHub release, or a Homebrew formula push — or the opposite, PR builds
# silently stop notarizing and the artifact regresses to unsigned.
#
# Hermetic — parses the YAML, no network, no runners.
