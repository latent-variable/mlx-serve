# Regression tests for client-disconnect handling during long prefills.
#
# Pins the 2026-06-10 live failure: Claude Code with a huge MCP toolset sent a
# ~40K-token prompt to gemma-4-12b, timed out waiting on the multi-minute cold
# prefill, disconnected, and RETRIED — but the server only checks the peer
# socket after a token arrives, so the handler sat blocked in waitNext for the
# whole prefill. Abandoned prefills piled up serially; `lsof` showed ZERO
# clients connected while the GPU ground away for minutes. The server looked
# dead ("not returning anything") and memory climbed with each ghost KV.
#
# Two contracts:
#   1. Keepalive: during a long prefill, streaming responses emit periodic
#      SSE pings (Anthropic `event: ping` / OpenAI `: keepalive` comments) so
#      clients don't hit their idle timeout in the first place.
#   2. Disconnect-cancel: when the client vanishes mid-prefill, the server
#      notices within one keepalive interval, cancels the slot (aborting the
#      prefill at the next chunk boundary), and the next request isn't stuck
#      behind a ghost.
#
# Usage: ./tests/test_disconnect_cancel.sh [model_dir] [port]
#   Starts its own server. Default model: Gemma 4 E4B 8-bit.
