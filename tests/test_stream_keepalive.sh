# Streaming-silence regression test (class guard).
#
# CLASS: a streaming surface that BUFFERS tokens must never let the socket go
# silent for longer than the keepalive interval.
#
# The server buffers generated tokens whenever it might be looking at a tool
# call (`chat.streamShouldBufferForTools`) or an unclosed thinking block
# (`chat.streamThinkGate` -> .hold_thinking). For a large tool call — an agent
# one-shotting a whole file into `write_file` — that buffer holds for the
# ENTIRE generation, and pre-fix the server wrote zero bytes for its whole
# duration. Clients with an idle-body timeout tear such a connection down
# mid-generation: Node's `fetch` (undici) defaults to `bodyTimeout: 300_000`,
# so any tool call that takes >5 min to generate dies as `TypeError: terminated`.
# Live failure 2026-07-08: a pi agent session building a JS game lost two
# ~5-minute `write` calls exactly this way (~10 min of GPU discarded).
#
# The keepalive used to fire only on `.idle` — i.e. only while WAITING for the
# first token (long prefill). Once tokens flowed into a buffer, it never fired.
#
# This test asserts, for EVERY streaming surface (chat / messages / responses):
#   1. the max inter-chunk gap stays under MAX_GAP_S even though the model
#      spends far longer than that inside one buffered tool call
#   2. at least one keepalive (`: keepalive` comment / `event: ping`) arrives
#   3. the tool call still parses — name intact, arguments are valid JSON
#      (the injected keepalive bytes must not corrupt the SSE stream)
#
# A surface whose generation finishes faster than MIN_BUFFER_S never exercised
# the buffer, so it SKIPs rather than passing vacuously.
#
# Requires:
#   - A built mlx-serve binary (zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast)
#   - KEEPALIVE_TEST_MODEL or ~/.mlx-serve/models/mlx-community/gemma-4-e4b-it-4bit
#
# Usage: ./tests/test_stream_keepalive.sh [port]
