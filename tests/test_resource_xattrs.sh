# Checked-in app resources must not carry the extended attributes that break
# code signing.
#
# An asset dragged out of Finder (a screen recording off the Desktop, an
# exported image) arrives with com.apple.FinderInfo attached. codesign then
# refuses the ENTIRE bundle:
#
#   MLX-Serve.app: resource fork, Finder information, or similar detritus not allowed
#
# — three minutes into a build, and naming the BINARY rather than the file that
# actually brought the metadata in, which sends you looking in the wrong place.
# build.sh strips them from the staged bundle so a build can't fail this way;
# this keeps the repo copies clean so the problem is caught in a second, with
# the offending file named and the fix printed.
#
# ONLY the attributes that actually break signing are checked. com.apple.macl
# and com.apple.provenance are added by macOS itself whenever a sandboxed app
# touches a file — every existing resource carries them and always has, and
# they sign fine. Failing on those would make this script fail forever through
# no fault of anyone's, and a guard that cries wolf gets deleted.
