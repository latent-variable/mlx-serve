# Sliding-window BLOCK trim byte-equivalence, per arch.
#
# A sliding layer only needs the tail its queries can reach: `window` for a
# decode step, `window + q_len - 1` for a block-wide forward. Decode has always
# trimmed; the block half used to fall through and read the ENTIRE cache on
# every sliding layer (see CLAUDE.md, docs/gotchas/engine-mlx.md).
#
# Trimming the K/V view is only correct if every consumer of that view derives
# its query offset RELATIVELY. This test is the proof: greedy (temperature 0)
# output with MLX_SERVE_SLIDING_BLOCK_TRIM=1 must be BYTE-IDENTICAL to the same
# request with =0, at a context well past the window. A diff means that arch's
# mask or bias reads absolute positions and is not view-relative — report it,
# don't ship it.
#
# Each arm asserts an `[sliding] block trim engaged` line in its OWN log (the
# =0 arm asserts its ABSENCE), so a silently-declined trim reads as a failure
# rather than a pass.
#
# The prompt is sized past window + prefill chunk on purpose: below that the
# span covers the whole cache and no trim happens, so the two arms would agree
# for the wrong reason.
#
# Requires a built binary (`zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`) and at least one
# checkpoint. Every arch is env-gated and skipped when absent.
#
# Usage:
#   SLIDING_GEMMA4_MOE_MODEL=/path SLIDING_LAGUNA_MODEL=/path \
#   SLIDING_INKLING_MODEL=/path SLIDING_GPT_OSS_MODEL=/path \

# Deterministic filler followed by a question whose answer lives at the TOP of
# the prompt — so an attention window that reads the wrong slice of the cache
# changes the answer, not just the phrasing.
#
# Length is per-arch. A prefill CHUNK only takes the trim once it lands at a
# non-zero offset (chunk 1 has total_kv == seq_len, which the span always
# covers), so a serial arch needs a prompt past 2x the default 8192 chunk —
# at 8k it prefills in ONE chunk and the two arms agree for the wrong reason.
