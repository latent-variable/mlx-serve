"""Repackage hexgrad/Kokoro-82M as an mlx-serve model dir.

USER-RUN (needs torch + safetensors + numpy + huggingface_hub, ~330 MB
download; safetensors serialises through numpy, so it is NOT optional). Not
run in CI. Produces the dir `src/kokoro.zig` loads:

    <out>/config.json            upstream config + "model_type": "kokoro"
    <out>/model.safetensors      f32 trunk, weight-norm FOLDED
    <out>/voices.safetensors     54 voice packs, one tensor each [510, 1, 256]
    <out>/g2p/{us_gold,us_silver,gb_gold}.json   pronunciation dictionaries

Usage:
    python3 tests/convert_kokoro_weights.py --out ~/.mlx-serve/models/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M-mlx-serve

Published as `ddalcu/Kokoro-82M-MLX-Serve` (f32, ~345 MB, `g2p/` included) —
what `AudioModelPreset.kokoro82M` downloads. `--upload` ignores `.DS_Store`;
a hand-rolled `hf upload` must pass `--exclude ".DS_Store"` itself.

WHY EACH TRANSFORM EXISTS
-------------------------

(a) WEIGHT-NORM FOLDING. Every Conv1d/ConvTranspose1d in the text encoder,
    the AdaIN residual blocks and the iSTFTNet generator is wrapped in
    `weight_norm`, which stores the weight factored as magnitude `g` and
    direction `v` (`parametrizations.weight.original0/original1` on modern
    torch, `weight_g`/`weight_v` on old). The engine wants the product, so we
    fold once here: `w = g · v/‖v‖`, norm taken over every axis EXCEPT 0
    (torch's `weight_norm` default `dim=0`, for ConvTranspose1d too — where
    axis 0 is C_IN, not C_out; folding is dim-agnostic so this is safe, but do
    not "fix" the axis on the assumption that axis 0 means output channels).

    Detection is by KEY SHAPE, not a hardcoded module list — a list would
    silently miss a module if upstream adds one, and an unfolded conv produces
    quiet, wrong audio rather than an error.

(b) NO LAYOUT TRANSPOSE. Conv weights stay in PyTorch layout; the engine
    transposes at use through `ltx_audio.zig`'s conv helpers, which is the
    convention that file already established. Do not pre-transpose here or the
    two halves disagree.

(c) f32 THROUGHOUT — and this was MEASURED, not assumed. Do not "optimize" it.

    71% of the weights (57.7M of 81.1M) are 3-D conv tensors, and mlx has NO
    quantized conv kernel (only quantized_matmul / gather_qmm). So quantizing
    them buys a smaller download and NOTHING else: they must be dequantized to
    run, and RAM stays at 325 MB either way.

    Quality, via the KOKORO_FIXTURES oracle on the same prompt and voice:

        variant              durations   f0        asr       audio
        f32 (this script)    EXACT       1.000000  1.000000  0.996831
        8-bit everything     EXACT       0.999998  0.999996  0.973787
        8-bit matmuls only   EXACT       0.999999  0.999997  0.915636
        4-bit everything     EXACT       0.999655  0.998833  0.069956

    The reference's own seed-to-seed spread is 0.9941–0.9960, so even 8-bit is
    measurably outside it. Note how the INTERMEDIATES stay at ~0.99999 while the
    waveform collapses at 4-bit: per-stage cosines say almost nothing here,
    because the vocoder loop compounds small weight errors over hundreds of
    steps. Same trap as the MageFlow bf16 finding.

    Caveat on the metric: 8-bit-matmuls-only scoring WORSE than
    8-bit-everything is not a real quality ordering — waveform cosine is
    phase-sensitive, so it partly measures "phase shifted". At 4-bit (0.07) it
    is unambiguous. In a listening test 8-bit was indistinguishable from f32.

    Verdict: ship f32. 325 MB is already small, RAM does not improve, and the
    generator is the one place precision demonstrably matters. If a download-size
    build is ever wanted, the honest option is an 8-bit STORAGE mirror that
    dequantizes at load (86 MB pull, same RAM, same speed) — not a runtime win.

WHAT IS PRUNED
--------------
  - `bert.pooler.*` — `CustomAlbert.forward` returns `last_hidden_state` and
    never builds the pooled output, so these weights are dead. A wrong prune
    fails LOUDLY at load (the engine errors on a missing key), so this is safe
    to be aggressive about.

PRONUNCIATION DICTIONARIES
--------------------------
Fetched verbatim from hexgrad/misaki (Apache-2.0, same owner and licence as
Kokoro itself) into `<out>/g2p/`. ~9 MB for the three English tables.

This is the one asset with a LICENCE TRAP attached: upstream Kokoro's default
phonemizer path falls back to espeak-ng, which is GPLv3 and would contaminate a
shipped closed app. misaki's dictionaries carry no such term. Never add an
espeak fallback to the Zig side.

Shape: 90k entries per table, values are either a plain IPA string or, for the
~790 heteronyms, an object keyed by part of speech
(`{"DEFAULT": "ˈæbz", "NOUN": null}`) — so the loader needs a POS tagger to
resolve those, and a null means "no pronunciation for this POS, fall through".

VOICE PACKS
-----------
A voice is NOT a single 256-float style vector. Each `.pt` is `[510, 1, 256]`
and the reference indexes it by the phoneme count of the utterance
(`pack[len(ps)-1]`). We keep the whole table per voice so the engine can do the
same; collapsing it to one row is a silent quality regression.

# Kokoro-82M for mlx-serve

[Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) repacked for
[mlx-serve](https://github.com/ddalcu/mlx-serve)'s native Zig + MLX engine.

Same weights, same precision — **f32, not quantized**. The repack folds
weight-norm into `.weight` (so the engine has no `weight_g`/`weight_v` to
resolve), drops the unused pooler tensors, converts `.pth` to safetensors, and
bundles the 54 voice packs plus the English pronunciation dictionaries the
phonemizer needs.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `model.safetensors` | 457 tensors, 81.1M params, 325 MB f32 |
| `voices.safetensors` | 54 voice packs, `[510, 1, 256]` each |
| `g2p/*.json` | misaki `us_gold` / `us_silver` / `gb_gold` |

Verified against the torch reference: per-phoneme durations match **exactly**,
F0 / noise / text-encoder outputs at cosine 1.000000, and the waveform at 0.9968
— which is inside the reference's own seed-to-seed spread (0.9941–0.9960), since
its vocoder is stochastic.

About **17x realtime** on an M-series Mac, ~350 MB resident.

## Run it

Download **[MLX-Serve.app](https://github.com/ddalcu/mlx-serve/releases/latest)**,
open Settings ▸ Voice, and pick **Kokoro** as the voice engine. 54 voices, and
naming several separated by commas blends them into a new one.

Over HTTP:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11234/v1/audio/speech \\
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
  -d '{"model":"kokoro","input":"Hello there.","voice":"af_bella,af_sky"}' \\
  --output out.wav
```

## Credit

Kokoro-82M and the misaki G2P dictionaries are both by
[hexgrad](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad), Apache-2.0. This repo only changes
the packaging. No espeak-ng anywhere in the pipeline — the dictionaries make it
unnecessary, which keeps the whole path Apache-2.0.
